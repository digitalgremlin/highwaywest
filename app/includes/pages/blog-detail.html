          <p class="post-text">The free spirited nature of some travelers sometimes means that trips are booked impulsively and the plans are often as open as the road that leads them to their destination. For those who put the plans in the backseat and don&#8217;t plan activities ahead of time, we have some good news for you! Here are some great summer events in Coos Bay!</p>
          <p class="post-text">Our Oceanside Beachfront RV Resort in Coos Bay, OR has a number of recurring local events that may occur during your visit.
